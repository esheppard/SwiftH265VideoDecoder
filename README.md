# Swift H264 | H265 Video Decoder
Demonstrates decoding H.265 (HEVC) and H.264 (AVC) video from RTP packets.

I recently went down a rabbit-hole trying to get video decoding working in Swift â€“ there isn't alot of sample code available and the implementation is quite technical. Hopefully others find this useful. Pull requests welcome for bug fixes or improvements!
